# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sreejesh A!

## 💻 About Me
I’m Sreejesh, an AI/ML Engineer and MCA graduate from Kerala, India 🇮🇳. I completed my Master of Computer Applications from Government Engineering College, Thrissur (under APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University).

My primary focus is on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, where I enjoy building intelligent systems, experimenting with models, and solving real-world problems using data-driven approaches. I have a strong interest in areas such as deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and applied AI solutions.

Alongside AI/ML, I also explore backend development and problem solving through platforms like LeetCode, constantly improving my analytical and coding skills.

I believe in consistency, simplicity, and creating technology that makes a meaningful impact. My goal is to contribute to innovative AI solutions that are practical, scalable, and beneficial to society.

I believe in consistency, simplicity, and creating things that solve real problems or spark curiosity. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me relaxing with a cup of tea ☕ and enjoying good conversations.

Let’s build something awesome together! 🚀
